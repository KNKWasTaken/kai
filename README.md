# KAI
Artificial Intelligence by KNKWasTaken, stands for KNK Artificial Intelligence
---

Powered by _OpenAI_
Uses _Davinci_ Engine

**Note:-**  The AI uses OpenAI Module, so you need to download it,

```
pip install openai
```

also, to use OpenAI, you need to log into or create your OpenAI account at [this link](https://platform.openai.com)

then you need to go to documents > quickstart and scroll down to secret api key and generate one

**Note:-**   Once the secret api key is copied, OpenAI will not show the key again. I personnaly advice that you copy the key somewhere

you need to replace the `yourapikey` in line  with your actual api key

```py
api_key = "yourapikey"
openai.api_key = api_key
```
